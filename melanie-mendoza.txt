Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? -  Inline elements allow elements to be nested within other elements without disrupting the flow of content.
        They take up the space of their content, can be on the same line, and height/width properties are disabled. Block Elements take up the height of content, width of page by default. We can customize the height and width
        They start on new lines. 


    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? Use display: block;

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
         display: block = <p>; <h1-6>; <nav>
         display: inline = <a> <span>
         display: inline-block = <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?  It's how each element relates and are positioned in the page, in boxes. Box-sizing allows us to overcome some of the shortcomings of the mox model.
